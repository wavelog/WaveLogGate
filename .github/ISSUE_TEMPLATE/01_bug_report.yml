        ## 
        ### 👋 Hello and welcome
        Thanks for reporting a bug! To fix issues efficiently, we need complete information. Incomplete reports often make it impossible to reproduce or solve the problem.
        
        ⏱️ Please fill out all required fields carefully. The few minutes you invest here save hours of back-and-forth questions later.
